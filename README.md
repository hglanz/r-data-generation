# Synthetic Data Generation in R

Authors: Aditi Gajjar, Hunter Glanz

Resources:
* https://r-pkgs.org/
* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/sample_generators.html

Goals:
* make_classification() from sklearn
* make_regression() from sklearn
* datasets from here: https://mschroth.shinyapps.io/classificationapp/
* simulated data for ANOVA (this could be a wrapper or something for make_regression)
* "make_clustering" to simulate data for clustering
* generic single quantitative variable with specified shape, center, spread
* generic single categorical variable with specified number of levels and "shape" (?)
